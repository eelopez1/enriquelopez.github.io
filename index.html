    COVID-19 disrupted the landscape of small businesses in Central New York, but opportunity may still be alive despite a crumbling economy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Small businesses faced deep challenges as COVID-19 changed the entire world overnight. The Office of the New York State Comptroller details that in May of 2020, only two months after CNY’s first reported case of COVID, NY state small businesses saw <a href=https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/small-businesses-and-economic-recovery-work-progress> a 77 percent decline in revenue and a 35 percent decline in employees. </a>  Small business owners continued to face difficulties well past the start of the Pandemic, the NY Comptroller found that more than <a href=https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/small-businesses-and-economic-recovery-work-progress> 80 percent of small businesses surveyed in their report communicated negative effects in October 2021. </a>

  The US government in turn propped the failing economy through stimuli like the CARES Act, which as of November 2021 distributed <a href= https://www.sba.gov/article/2021/nov/24/fact-sheet-us-small-business-administration-delivering-support-americas-small-businesses-helping> $416.3 billion to 6 million small businesses</a>, according to the Small Business Administration. Those numbers climbed as COVID relief spending grew. As Nasdaq reports total COVID relief amounts to <a href= https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/money-printing-and-inflation%3A-covid-cryptocurrencies-and-more> $5.2 trillion,</a> including $1.8 billion in Paycheck Protection Program loans to businesses across the five counties of CNY: Cayuga, Cortland, Madison, Onondaga, and Oswego.

    The COVID relief and PPP loans were needed for the people and businesses struggling to survive, but their effectiveness is questionable. Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises at Syracuse University, Dr. Zachary Rodriguez says the future outlook for these programs is bleak.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We know businesses aren't really up to where they were. So where did all that money go? How did they use that money? Probably not very well. Probably just paid people. Probably just got labor costs lower,” he said. “And so if anything, it relieves sort of short-term pressure. But what it does is creates long-term pressure.” 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    The National Bureau of Economic Research found <a href= https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29669/w29669.pdf> only 23 to 34 percent</a> of allocated PPP funds went to workers who would have lost jobs, the other portion went to business owners and creditors. The large demand for PPP highlights how small businesses across the country were starved for opportunities and funds. The rise in federal assistance lead to a <a href= https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/money-printing-and-inflation%3A-covid-cryptocurrencies-and-more> 27 percent increase in the money supply</a>, which can cause inflation.
  </p>
 
  <div class="quote">

   "We just created a ton of dollars and dump them into the economy. So obviously that creates an enormous amount of inflation. And you and I are living in this world now."

  <p>
    “Well, at this moment, it's pretty tough because we're going through sort of a reset with the economy. So, it's pretty hard to borrow money right now. It's pretty expensive to borrow money, interest rates are very high, and so it's not necessarily the best time to start a small business,” he says. “But it depends on how small, these days people are starting businesses online. The costs are pretty low, but something like a brick and mortar store in Syracuse, probably wait a year.”
  </p>

  <p>
    As COVID winds down, small businesses can look towards recovery, but the looming economic crisis can change that. In Syracuse, businesses have reopened as mask policies and in-person restrictions ended. Downtown Syracuse and the restaurant scene have got a new burst of energy as people want to enjoy time outside. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The Syracuse University campus is back to life too as the school allowed for maskless classes for a portion of the Spring semester. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Dr. Rodriguez says this recovery may be short-lived.
  </p>
  
  <div class="quote">

   “This upcoming crash is going to be bad for everybody, and so it's going to really stunt or prevent things from moving, at least for another few months. So the recovery is still happening. It's coming, but there's still more bad news.”

    </div>
  <p>
    Despite the deteriorating economy, COVID has unlocked opportunities for businesses that were willing to adapt and fit into the changing market. New York State entrepreneurs agree. The NY Comptroller reports that the number of new business applications increased by <a href= https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/small-businesses-and-economic-recovery-work-progress> 22.1 percent from 2020 to 2021.</a> Many look past the societal change and economic downfall and see business opportunities. Dr. Rodriguez cites early adopters of technology as those who succeeded faster. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Low-cost, online businesses have potential in today’s age. Technology has brought opportunity among economic chaos and a global health crisis. Delivery service businesses like GrubHub, DoorDash, and UberEats have exploded. Many Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic turned to these gig jobs to sustain themselves. Further, social media has revolutionized online marketing and small business. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Dr. Rodriguez says the pandemic has changed the business platform through social media.
  </p>

  <p>
    “The thing that I've noticed most from this whole crisis is that social media and marketplace are kinds of blending together,” he says. “They're not necessarily different anymore, which is weird. We're kind of acting like it's not a big deal, but it is when you're consuming at the same time as trying to be on social media.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Amidst the largest health crisis in a century, small businesses adapted and sought ways to survive a quickly changing world; but the future is still uncertain as inflation is set to rise and an economic crisis develops in the background.
